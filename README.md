Create code generator website that generates MD5 hash codes
Detail Explanation:
**Input**: These websites typically provide a text input field where you can enter the data for which you want to generate an MD5 hash. This data can be a password, a message, or any other information.

**Processing**: Once you enter the data, the website's backend code processes it using the MD5 algorithm. The algorithm transforms the input data into a fixed-size hash value.

**Output**: The generated MD5 hash is then displayed on the website. This hash is unique to the input data. Even a small change in the input data should result in a significantly different MD5 hash.

**Use Cases**: MD5 hash codes are commonly used for checking data integrity, storing passwords (though it's not recommended due to its vulnerability to attacks), and verifying the authenticity of files.
